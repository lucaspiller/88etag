# 88etag

88etag is a clone of the multiplayer action rts [Gate 88](http://www.queasygames.com/gate88/). Written in Javascript.

## Play now!

A demo is availabe on the [GitHub pages](http://lucaspiller.github.com/88etag/) for this project, controls are:

    Arrows - Move ship
    D      - Fire
    Q      - Construct turret
    W      - Construct mass driver

## Get Involved

The game is still under early (active) development, if you would like to get involved it is probably best to PM me so we don't both work on the same thing.

For now I am planning to just clone the functionality of Gate 88 (including multiplayer!), and extra features will be added once that is completeted.
